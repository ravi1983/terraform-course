Terraform:
    Infrastructure as code
    Automation of infra
    Keeps and maintains state of the infra
    Makes the infra auditable, but checking in to git and doing peer review
    While chef, puppet etc.,focus on installing and configuring the software, terraform creates the underlying infra in say AWS, Azure or other cloud providers
    But works well with config software such as Chef, Puppet after infra is created.

Installation:
    Just unzip and add terraform binary to PATH

Execution:
    Run `terraform init` to download cloud provider details. This is needed for every new directory
    Run `terraform apply` to proceed with creation of resources
    Run `terraform destroy` all the resources created with apply command
    Run `terraform plan` to understand what terraform will do on applying this config. This command does not create any resources.
        Can add option -out <filename> to save the output of plan command to the specified file
    To be safe, it is always recommended to do plan save the output to a file and then do apply on that file.
        terraform plan <filename>; terraform apply <filename>

Variables:
    Everything in one file is not great.
    Add AWS creds in a file that will be added to git repo is not good.
    So we need to save the AWS creds in a separate file and not commit to git.
    We can also define variables to make a template more generic. (e.g., make AMIs as variable since they change with each region)
    Variables make template very generic and hence make it reusable
    Syntax to refer variable in template is ${var.<variable name>} assuming the file that contains the variables in var.tf. Can also be referred like so var.<variable name>
    In var.tf, we can either no assign any value to a variable or provide default values. Default values can be maps.
    Use terraform.tfvard to provide values for all variables defined in var.tf. This file will be added to gitignore.
    Can also split up the template further into provider.tf (refers to AWS variables) and instance.tf (mentions resources that need to be created)
    In the end spliting config in following different templates is ideal:
        terraform.tfvars - Will contains the AWS creds. DO NOT checkin
        vars.tf - Will contain default vars, and empty declaration for vars that will be specified in terraform.tfvars
        provider.tf - Will mention the cloud provider and creds to connect to them
        instance.tf - Will specify the list of resources that need to be created
